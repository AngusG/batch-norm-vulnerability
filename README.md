# batch-norm-vulnerability
Master source code repo for "Batch Normalization is a Cause of Adversarial Vulnerability"

- Link to [MNIST MFT experiments](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/bn-robust-mft). We reproduce the setup from [Yang et al., ICLR 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08129) and evaluate the trainability and robustness of fully-connected networks with 10-60 layers for mini-batch sizes 5-250, with and without batch norm. 
- Link to [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C experiments with unnormalized residual networks](https://github.com/AngusG/bn-advex-zhang-fixup). Repo contains two pre-trained checkpoints for ResNet110 (with and without batch norm).
